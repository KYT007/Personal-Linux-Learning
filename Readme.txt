Linux File Permissions Exploration

	What is the purpose of this project? While it might seem pointless, this project is to demonstrate working knowledge of manipulating file permissions in the Linux command line.


What’s included here? 
	-A file titled “LinxFilePermissions.odt”
	-A Readme file for this entry (you’re currently reading it)

Key Topics Explored
We explore topics like:
    •  Viewing files AND their permissions in a directory by using ls -la, ls l (you’ll also see the typical  “ls”  used at times!)
    •  The file permissions string
    •  The chmod command
    •  Viewing hidden files in a directory and changing their permissions

How To Use This:

	Simply open the LinxFilePermissions.odt document and read on!
